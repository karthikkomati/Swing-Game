# Swing-Game

Designed a dungeon crawling game with a text based interface and a graphical interface using Model-View-Controller architecture. Includes a randomly generated dungeon containing monsters and treasure with features such as the ability to move with mouse or keyboard, shoot arrows and collect treasure.
There is a graphical controller created using java swing as well as a text based controller. Added JUnit tests for every class to test the functionality.
